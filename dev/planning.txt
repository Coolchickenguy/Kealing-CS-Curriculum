Plans: Replace quick-db with something bedder.
How: create my own database.
Structure: Binary
(Remember):Binary all-1 numbers :(1,2,4,8,16)  1,3,7,15,31
AIM: MAX OF 7 FLAGS
Flags:
 *Object : 0
 *Next : 1
 *NextArray : 2
 *NextObject : 3
 *Array : 4
{"chickens":["cool","great","Don't eat",{"why":["they are cool","Because I said so"]}]}
Would look like:
