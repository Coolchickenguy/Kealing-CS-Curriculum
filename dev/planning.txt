Plans: Replace quick-db with something bedder.
How: create my own database.
Structure: Binary
(Remember):Binary all-1 numbers :(1,2,4,8,16)  1,3,7,15,31
AIM: MAX OF 7 FLAGS
Flags:
 *Next : 0
 *Object : 1
 *Array : 2
 *End : 3
{"chickens":["cool","great","Don't eat",{"why":["they are cool","Because I said so"]}],"dogs":"whatever"}
Would look like:
1chickens2cool0great0Don't eat01why2they are cool0Because I said so3330dogs0whatever
Of couse, that would require createing a new carecter encodeing that leavs out 000,001,010,011,100 and uses 3-bit bytes

Array:["Bock",{"happy":"Buck Buck buck...","angry":"BOCK!"}]
Would look like:
2Bock01happy0Buck Buck buck...0angry0BOCK!33
